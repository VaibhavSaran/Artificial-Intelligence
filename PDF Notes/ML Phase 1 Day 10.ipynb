    "1. <b>1 Bit Image</b>:\n",
    "  - It is also known as `Binary Image` or `1 Bit Monochrome Image`.\n",
    "  - In this format each pixel is stored as 0 or 1, i.e. in a bit.\n",
    "  - The clarity/quality of 1 Bit Image is very low.<br>\n",
    "  <img src=\"Image Types\\1 bit image.jpeg\">\n",
    "  - This is an example of 1 Bit Image.\n",
    "  - <u><b>Pixel value 0 ‚üπ White and 1 ‚üπ Black</b></u>.\n",
    "2. <b>8 Bit Gray Level Image</b>:\n",
    "  - It is also know as a `Monochrome Image`.\n",
    "  - Each pixel is represented by a single byte (8 Bits)\n",
    "  $$Each \\ pixel \\ can \\ hold \\ 2^{8} = 256 \\ values$$\n",
    "  - The images in this type are exclusively composed of <u>*Gray Shades*</u>; where 0 is to represent `black color` {No Intensity/Brightness} and 255 is to represent `white color` {Full Intensity/Brightness}.\n",
    "  - In gray scale image the value of each pixel is a single sample, which carries intensity information. For e.g.\n",
    "    - Dark Pixel = 15 *{Dark Grey}*\n",
    "    - Light Pixel = 240 *{Dark White / Light Gray}*\n",
    "  - An image is represented using bit map. A bit map is a simple matrix of pixels that form an image which is either displayed on a computer screen or printed.\n",
    "  - Example of 8 Bit Gray Level Image:<br>\n",
    "  <img src=\"Image Types\\8 bit Gray level Images.jpeg\">\n",
    "3. <b>24 Bit Color Image</b>:\n",
    "  - In this each pixel of an image is represented using 3 bytes.\n",
    "  - Usually the 3 bytes represent RGB.\n",
    "  - A `true color` is defined to mean 256 shades of RGB for a total of 16.7 million color variations.\n",
    "  - These images provide a method of representing and storing a graphical image information in a RGB colorspace in its `true color`, which in turn allows for a large number of variations of color, shades &hues to be displayed and stored.\n",
    "  - The `24 Bit Image` is often stored as a `32 Bit Image`, where the extra byte is used to store an *`Alpha`* value for each pixel in the image. `Alpha` represents the special effect information for an image like transparency.\n",
    "  - Example of 24 Bit Color Image v/s 30 Bit Image:<br>\n",
    "  <img src=\"Image Types\\24 bit color images.jpeg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Drawbacks:\n",
    "    - It requires a lot of storage space.\n",
    "    - Most monitors are only capable to display 256 colors at a time, so the rest of the colors are wasted.\n",
    "4. <b>8 Bit Color Image</b>:\n",
    "  - Each pixel is represented with 1 Byte (8 Bits).\n",
    "  - The maximum number of colors which can be displayed in this format is 256. (0-255).\n",
    "  - 8 Bit color graphics are of 2 forms:\n",
    "    - Form 1:\n",
    "      - In this form a color is not stored instead, an 8 Bit index is stored into the color map of each pixel inplace of the full 24 bit color value.\n",
    "      - In layman terms, Imagine you have a box of crayons with numbers on them. Instead of using names like ‚Äúsky blue,‚Äù we just say ‚Äúnumber 5.‚Äù In the same way, computers use a small number to pick a color from a list. This saves a lot of space, like using a shortcut.\n",
    "      - This format has 2 parts:\n",
    "        - A color map describing what colors are present in the image.\n",
    "        - An array of index values for each pixel in an image.\n",
    "    - Form 2:\n",
    "      - In this form the bifurcation of 8 Bits is as follows ‚ü∂ {3 Red, 3 Green, 2 Blue}\n",
    "      - It is often called as the 8 Bit True color as it does not use the pallete wall.\n",
    "      - When a 24 bit full color image is turned into 8 Bit image, some colors have to be eliminated which is called as **COLOR QUANTIZATION** process.\n",
