    "\n",
    "- A simple way to specify a finite set of strings is to list its elements or members. <br>For example `{Doc1,1,Doc2,2,Doc3,3}`. \n",

    "`{Doc1,Doc2,Doc3}` can be specified by the pattern `Doc(1|2|3)`. <br>We say that this pattern matches each of the two strings. [Lets check?](https://regex101.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "> In most formalisms, if there exists at least one regular expression that matches a particular set then there exists an infinite number of other regular expressions that also match it, i.e. **the specification is not unique**.<br>\n",
    "For example, the string set `{Doc1,Doc2,Doc3}` can also be specified by the pattern `Doc\\d`.\n",
